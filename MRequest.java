//Firstly decide on how to make HTTP(S)requests
/*
Can use:
1.HTTPURLConnection
2.Apache HTTP Client 
3. Java 11 HTTP/2 HTTP Client supports earlier HTTP/1.1 Too

Based off what I read option number 3 is common and recommended while option 2 is reasonable but older 

Language: decided on Java since test is for Java position
